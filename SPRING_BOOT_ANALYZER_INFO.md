# Understanding spring_boot_analyzer

## What is spring_boot_analyzer?

`spring_boot_analyzer` is a Python program that acts like a smart assistant for developers working with Spring Boot applications. It uses artificial intelligence to answer questions about the codebase, suggest how to implement new features, and analyze the impact of code changes.

## What Does It Do?

Imagine having an expert developer who knows every detail of your codebase and can instantly answer any question you have about it. That's what `spring_boot_analyzer` aims to be:

1. **Answers Questions**: You can ask natural language questions about the application, such as:
   - "How does the login process work?"
   - "What happens when a user transfers money between accounts?"
   - "How is user data stored and retrieved?"

2. **Plans New Features**: You can describe a new feature you want to add, and it will suggest:
   - Which files need to be modified
   - What new code needs to be written
   - How the feature should integrate with existing code

3. **Analyzes Code Changes**: You can describe a change you want to make, and it will tell you:
   - Which parts of the code will be affected
   - Potential side effects or risks
   - What testing should be done

4. **Self-Verifies Responses**: It double-checks its own answers to ensure they're consistent with the actual codebase.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Context Management**: It loads summaries, diagrams, and other information generated by `glean_code_ds.py`

2. **Semantic Search**: When you ask a question, it finds the most relevant parts of the code using AI-powered similarity search

3. **Prompt Construction**: It builds a detailed prompt that includes:
   - The application overview
   - Summaries of the most relevant components
   - API flow information
   - Component relationship data

4. **LLM Interaction**: It sends the prompt to a large language model (like GPT-4) to generate a response

5. **Self-Verification**: It checks the response for accuracy and consistency with the codebase

## Why Is It Useful?

- **Saves Time**: Instantly answers questions that would otherwise require hours of code reading
- **Reduces Errors**: Helps identify potential issues before making code changes
- **Accelerates Development**: Makes it easier to plan and implement new features
- **Supports Learning**: Helps new team members understand the codebase quickly
- **Improves Decision-Making**: Provides insights for architectural and design decisions

## How to Use It

You can use `spring_boot_analyzer` in several ways:

1. **Interactive Mode**: Have a conversation with the analyzer, asking follow-up questions
2. **Query Mode**: Ask specific one-off questions
3. **Feature Analysis**: Get guidance on implementing new features
4. **Impact Analysis**: Understand the implications of code changes
5. **As a Library**: Integrate it into your own tools and workflows

In simple terms, `spring_boot_analyzer` is like having an AI assistant that has read and understood your entire codebase, ready to answer questions and provide guidance whenever you need it.
