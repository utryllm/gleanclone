# Summary of AccountService.java

1. Primary Purpose: The primary purpose of the `AccountService` class is to provide services related to the `Account` model. This includes retrieving accounts by sort code and account number, retrieving accounts by account number only, and creating new accounts.

2. Key Spring Annotations: The key Spring annotation used in this class is `@Service`. This annotation is used at the class level to indicate that the class provides business services.

3. Dependencies and Autowired Components: The `AccountService` class depends on two repositories: `AccountRepository` and `TransactionRepository`. These dependencies are injected into the `AccountService` through its constructor.

4. Public Methods and their Functionality:
   - `getAccount(String sortCode, String accountNumber)`: This method retrieves an account based on the provided sort code and account number. If the account exists, it also sets the transactions for the account.
   - `getAccount(String accountNumber)`: This method retrieves an account based on the provided account number.
   - `createAccount(String bankName, String ownerName)`: This method creates a new account with the provided bank name and owner name. It generates a sort code and account number for the new account and initializes its balance to 0.00.

5. Relationships with Other Components: The `AccountService` class interacts with the `AccountRepository` and `TransactionRepository` to perform CRUD operations on the `Account` model. It also uses the `CodeGenerator` utility to generate sort codes and account numbers when creating new accounts.
