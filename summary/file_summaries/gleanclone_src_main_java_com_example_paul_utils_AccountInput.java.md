# Summary of AccountInput.java

1. Primary Purpose: The `AccountInput` class is a simple Java POJO (Plain Old Java Object) that represents an account input with two properties: `sortCode` and `accountNumber`. This class is typically used to encapsulate the data that is being passed around between methods and layers in the application, especially for data transfer between the client and server in a web application.

2. Key Spring Annotations: This class does not use any Spring-specific annotations. However, it uses the `@NotBlank` annotation from the `javax.validation.constraints` package to enforce that both `sortCode` and `accountNumber` must not be blank.

3. Dependencies and Autowired Components: This class does not have any dependencies or autowired components as it is a simple data holder class.

4. Public Methods: 
   - `getSortCode()`: Returns the sort code of the account.
   - `setSortCode(String sortCode)`: Sets the sort code of the account.
   - `getAccountNumber()`: Returns the account number.
   - `setAccountNumber(String accountNumber)`: Sets the account number.
   - `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the `AccountInput` object.
   - `equals(Object o)`: Checks if the current `AccountInput` object is equal to another object.
   - `hashCode()`: Returns a hash code value for the object.

5. Relationships with Other Components: As a POJO, `AccountInput` can be used in various parts of an application. However, without additional context or code, it's not possible to determine specific relationships with other components. Typically, such a class could be used in service layers, controllers, or data access objects (DAOs) to encapsulate data.
