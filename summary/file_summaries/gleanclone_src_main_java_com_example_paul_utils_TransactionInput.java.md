# Summary of TransactionInput.java

1. Primary Purpose: The `TransactionInput` class is a data model that represents the input for a transaction. It includes details about the source account, target account, transfer amount, reference, and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).

2. Key Spring Annotations Used: This class does not use any Spring-specific annotations. However, it uses Java's built-in validation constraints such as `@Positive`, `@Min`, and `@Max` to ensure that the input values are within the acceptable range.

3. Dependencies and Autowired Components: This class does not have any dependencies or autowired components. It only has fields for source account, target account, amount, reference, latitude, and longitude.

4. Public Methods and Their Functionality: The class provides getter and setter methods for all its fields. These methods are used to retrieve and modify the values of the fields. It also overrides the `toString()` method from the `Object` class to provide a string representation of the `TransactionInput` object.

5. Relationships with Other Components: The `TransactionInput` class has a relationship with the `AccountInput` class, as it uses `AccountInput` objects for its `sourceAccount` and `targetAccount` fields. However, without additional context, it's unclear how this class interacts with other components in the larger application.
