# Summary of CodeGenerator.java

1. Primary Purpose: The primary purpose of the `CodeGenerator` class is to generate random sort codes and account numbers. It uses the `Generex` class from the `com.mifmif.common.regex` package to generate these codes based on predefined patterns.

2. Key Spring Annotations: There are no Spring annotations used in this class. This is a utility class and does not interact with the Spring framework directly.

3. Dependencies and Autowired Components: This class has a dependency on the `Generex` class from the `com.mifmif.common.regex` package. It uses this class to generate random strings based on a regular expression. There are no autowired components in this class.

4. Public Methods and Their Functionality: 
   - `generateSortCode()`: This method generates a random sort code using the `sortCodeGenerex` object, which is initialized with a sort code pattern string.
   - `generateAccountNumber()`: This method generates a random account number using the `accountNumberGenerex` object, which is initialized with an account number pattern string.

5. Relationships with Other Components: This class does not have any explicit relationships with other classes in the system. However, it is likely used by other components that require the generation of random sort codes and account numbers. The specific pattern strings used for generating these codes are imported from the `com.example.paul.constants.constants` package.
