# Summary of CreateAccountInput.java

1. Primary Purpose: The primary purpose of the `CreateAccountInput` class is to serve as a data transfer object (DTO) that carries data for creating a new bank account. The class encapsulates the bank name and the owner's name as the necessary information for creating a new account.

2. Key Spring Annotations Used: This class does not use any Spring-specific annotations. However, it uses the `@NotBlank` annotation from the `javax.validation.constraints` package to enforce that the `bankName` and `ownerName` fields are not blank.

3. Dependencies and Autowired Components: This class does not have any dependencies or autowired components as it's a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) used for data transfer.

4. Public Methods and Their Functionality:
   - `getBankName()`: Returns the name of the bank.
   - `setBankName(String bankName)`: Sets the name of the bank.
   - `getOwnerName()`: Returns the name of the account owner.
   - `setOwnerName(String ownerName)`: Sets the name of the account owner.
   - `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the `CreateAccountInput` object.
   - `equals(Object o)`: Checks if the current `CreateAccountInput` object is equal to another object.
   - `hashCode()`: Returns a hash code value for the object.

5. Relationships with Other Components: This class does not have any explicit relationships with other components. However, it's likely used in conjunction with other components or services that handle account creation, where instances of this class would be passed as input data.
