# Summary of TransactionService.java

1. Primary Purpose: The `TransactionService` class is primarily responsible for handling transactions between accounts. It provides methods to make a transfer between accounts, update an account balance, and check if a certain amount is available in an account.

2. Key Spring Annotations: 
   - `@Service`: This annotation is used at the class level, indicating that `TransactionService` is a Service component in the Spring framework.
   - `@Autowired`: This annotation is used to automatically wire the `AccountRepository` and `TransactionRepository` dependencies.

3. Dependencies and Autowired Components: 
   - `AccountRepository`: This is a repository interface for `Account` objects, providing methods to access the data source.
   - `TransactionRepository`: This is a repository interface for `Transaction` objects, providing methods to access the data source.

4. Public Methods and their Functionality: 
   - `makeTransfer(TransactionInput transactionInput)`: This method is used to make a transfer from a source account to a target account. It checks if both accounts exist and if the source account has enough balance for the transfer. If the conditions are met, it creates a new transaction, updates the source account balance, saves the transaction, and returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.
   - `updateAccountBalance(Account account, double amount, ACTION action)`: This method updates the balance of a given account based on the action (withdraw or deposit) and the amount.
   - `isAmountAvailable(double amount, double accountBalance)`: This method checks if a certain amount is available in an account balance.

5. Relationships with Other Components: The `TransactionService` class interacts with the `AccountRepository` and `TransactionRepository` to perform operations related to transactions. It also uses `Account`, `Transaction`, `TransactionInput`, and `ACTION` classes for its operations.
