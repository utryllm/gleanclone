# Summary of TransactionRepository.java

1. The primary purpose of this class/interface:
The `TransactionRepository` interface is a Spring Data JPA repository that provides methods for performing database operations on `Transaction` entities. It is primarily used to interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the `Transaction` table.

2. Key Spring annotations used:
This class does not directly use any Spring annotations like `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Controller`, etc. However, it extends `JpaRepository`, which is a part of Spring Data JPA and provides several methods for interacting with the database.

3. Dependencies and autowired components:
There are no explicit dependencies or autowired components in this interface. However, by extending `JpaRepository`, it implicitly depends on Spring Data JPA.

4. Public methods and their functionality:
The `findBySourceAccountIdOrderByInitiationDate(long id)` method is a derived query method provided by Spring Data JPA. It fetches a list of `Transaction` entities from the database where the `sourceAccountId` matches the provided `id`, ordered by the `initiationDate`.

5. Relationships with other components:
The `TransactionRepository` interface is likely used by services or controllers in the application to perform database operations on `Transaction` entities. It is directly related to the `Transaction` model as it extends `JpaRepository` for `Transaction`.
