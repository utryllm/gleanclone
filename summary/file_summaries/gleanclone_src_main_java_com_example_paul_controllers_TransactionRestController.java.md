# Summary of TransactionRestController.java

1. Primary Purpose: The `TransactionRestController` class is a RESTful controller in a Spring Boot application that handles HTTP requests related to transactions. It provides endpoints for making a transfer, withdrawing, and depositing money.

2. Key Spring Annotations:
   - `@RestController`: This annotation is used at the class level to mark this class as a controller where every method returns a domain object instead of a view.
   - `@RequestMapping`: This annotation maps HTTP requests to handler methods of MVC and REST controllers.
   - `@Autowired`: This annotation is used to auto-wire Spring Bean on setter methods, constructor, a property or methods with arbitrary names and/or multiple arguments.
   - `@PostMapping`: This annotation is used to map HTTP POST requests onto specific handler methods.
   - `@Valid`: This annotation is used to validate the JavaBean to be validated.
   - `@RequestBody`: This annotation is used to bind the HTTP request body with a domain object in method parameter.
   - `@ResponseStatus`: This annotation is used to mark a method or exception class with the status code and reason that should be returned.
   - `@ExceptionHandler`: This annotation is used to handle the specific exceptions and sending the custom responses to the client.

3. Dependencies and Autowired Components: The `TransactionRestController` class depends on `AccountService` and `TransactionService`. These dependencies are autowired using the `@Autowired` annotation in the constructor.

4. Public Methods and their functionality:
   - `makeTransfer()`: This method is used to make a transfer. It validates the input and if valid, it calls the `makeTransfer()` method from `TransactionService`.
   - `withdraw()`: This method is used to withdraw money from an account. It validates the input and if valid, it retrieves the account information and checks if the withdrawal amount is available. If yes, it updates the account balance.
   - `deposit()`: This method is used to deposit money into an account. It validates the input and if valid, it retrieves the account information and updates the account balance.
   - `handleValidationExceptions()`: This method is used to handle validation exceptions and return a map of errors.

5. Relationships with other components: The `TransactionRestController` interacts with `AccountService` and `TransactionService` to perform operations related to transactions. It also uses `InputValidator` for input validation.
