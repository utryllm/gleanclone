# Summary of Account.java

1. Primary Purpose: The `Account` class is a model class in a Spring Boot application that represents a bank account. It holds information about the account such as the account number, sort code, current balance, bank name, owner name, and a list of transactions associated with the account.

2. Key Spring Annotations: The class uses the `@Entity` and `@Table` annotations from the Spring Data JPA library. `@Entity` indicates that the class is a JPA entity, meaning that instances of this class will be automatically mapped to rows in a database table. `@Table` is used to specify the name of the database table to which this entity is mapped, and the schema in which the table resides.

3. Dependencies and Autowired Components: The class does not have any autowired components or explicit dependencies. However, it does have a dependency on the `Transaction` class, as it maintains a list of `Transaction` objects.

4. Public Methods: The class has getter and setter methods for all its fields, allowing other classes to read and modify its state. It also has multiple constructors for creating `Account` objects with different sets of initial data. The `toString()` method is overridden to provide a string representation of the `Account` object, which can be useful for debugging or logging.

5. Relationships with Other Components: The `Account` class is related to the `Transaction` class, as it maintains a list of `Transaction` objects. This suggests that there is a one-to-many relationship between `Account` and `Transaction`, with one `Account` having many `Transactions`. The exact nature of this relationship would be determined by how these classes are used in the rest of the application.
