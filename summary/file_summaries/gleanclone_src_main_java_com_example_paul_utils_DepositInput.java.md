# Summary of DepositInput.java

1. Primary Purpose: The `DepositInput` class is a simple Java Bean (or POJO - Plain Old Java Object) that represents the data required for a deposit operation in a banking application. It holds information about the target account number and the amount to be deposited.

2. Key Spring Annotations Used: This class does not use any Spring-specific annotations. However, it uses Java's built-in validation annotations like `@NotBlank` and `@Positive` to enforce certain constraints on the fields.

3. Dependencies and Autowired Components: This class does not have any dependencies or autowired components as it is a simple data holder and does not interact with any other Spring components or services.

4. Public Methods and Their Functionality: 
   - `getTargetAccountNo()`: Returns the target account number.
   - `setTargetAccountNo(String targetAccountNo)`: Sets the target account number.
   - `getAmount()`: Returns the deposit amount.
   - `setAmount(double amount)`: Sets the deposit amount.
   - `toString()`: Returns a string representation of the `DepositInput` object.
   - `equals(Object o)`: Checks if the current `DepositInput` object is equal to another object.
   - `hashCode()`: Returns a hash code value for the object.

5. Relationships with Other Components: As a data holder, `DepositInput` could be used by various components in the application, such as services or controllers, to carry data for deposit operations. However, this specific relationship is not evident from the provided code.
