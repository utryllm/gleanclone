# Summary of AccountRestController.java

1. Primary Purpose: The `AccountRestController` class is a RESTful controller class in a Spring Boot application. It provides endpoints for checking an account balance and creating a new account.

2. Key Spring Annotations:
   - `@RestController`: This annotation is used at the class level to mark this class as a controller where every method returns a domain object instead of a view.
   - `@RequestMapping`: This is used at the class level to map a specific request path or pattern onto this controller.
   - `@Autowired`: This is used on the constructor to automatically wire the `AccountService` bean into this controller.
   - `@PostMapping` and `@PutMapping`: These annotations are used to map HTTP POST and PUT requests, respectively, onto specific handler methods.
   - `@ResponseStatus` and `@ExceptionHandler`: These are used to define a method that handles exceptions and sets the HTTP status code.

3. Dependencies and Autowired Components: The `AccountRestController` class depends on the `AccountService` class. This dependency is autowired via the constructor.

4. Public Methods and Their Functionality:
   - `checkAccountBalance`: This method handles POST requests to "/accounts" and checks the balance of an account based on the provided account input. It validates the input, retrieves the account information, and returns the account details or a warning message.
   - `createAccount`: This method handles PUT requests to "/accounts" and creates a new account based on the provided account input. It validates the input, creates the account, and returns the account details or a warning message.
   - `handleValidationExceptions`: This method handles `MethodArgumentNotValidException` exceptions and returns a map of field names and error messages.

5. Relationships with Other Components: The `AccountRestController` class interacts with the `AccountService` class to retrieve and create account information. It also uses `AccountInput` and `CreateAccountInput` for input validation, and `Account` as the model for the account data. It uses `InputValidator` to validate the input data.
