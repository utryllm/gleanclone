# Code Summarization

This directory contains summaries of the codebase generated using OpenAI's API.

## Directory Structure

- `file_summaries/`: Contains summaries of individual Java files.
- `module_summaries/`: Contains summaries of modules/packages.
- `summary_of_summaries.md`: A comprehensive overview of the entire application.

## How to Use

These summaries can be used to:

1. Quickly understand the purpose and functionality of individual files.
2. Get an overview of how different modules interact with each other.
3. Understand the high-level architecture of the application.
4. Make it easier for LLMs to answer questions about the codebase by providing context.

## Generation Process

The summaries are generated using the following process:

1. Individual file summaries are generated using the "Basic File Analysis Prompt".
2. Module summaries are generated by grouping file summaries by package/module and using the "Module Level Summarization" prompt.
3. The summary of summaries is generated using the "Creating a Summary of Summaries" prompt.

Additional analyses may include:
- Code flow analysis
- Spring context-specific analysis
