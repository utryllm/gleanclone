# Module Summary: com

The `com` package/module is a Spring Boot application designed to simulate an online banking system. It provides functionalities such as creating new accounts, checking account balances, making transactions (deposits, withdrawals, and transfers), and validating input data.

The `Application.java` class serves as the entry point for the application, invoking the `SpringApplication.run()` method to start the application. The `AccountRestController.java` and `TransactionRestController.java` classes are RESTful controllers that provide HTTP endpoints for account and transaction operations respectively. They interact with the `AccountService.java` and `TransactionService.java` classes, which handle business logic related to accounts and transactions. These services use `AccountRepository.java` and `TransactionRepository.java` to perform database operations.

The `Account.java` and `Transaction.java` classes are model classes that represent a bank account and a transaction respectively. They are used by the repositories and services to handle data. The `ACTION.java` enumeration is used to represent the two possible actions that can be performed in a banking system: DEPOSIT and WITHDRAW.

The `AccountInput.java`, `CreateAccountInput.java`, `TransactionInput.java`, `DepositInput.java`, and `WithdrawInput.java` classes are data transfer objects (DTOs) that encapsulate data for various operations. They are used by the controllers and services to pass data.

The `constants.java` class defines a set of constants that can be used throughout the application. The `CodeGenerator.java` class is a utility class used to generate random sort codes and account numbers. The `InputValidator.java` class is another utility class used to validate various types of inputs.

The flow of control in this application typically starts from the controllers, which receive HTTP requests. The controllers then call the appropriate methods in the services, passing in any necessary data encapsulated in DTOs. The services perform the necessary business logic and use the repositories to interact with the database. The repositories use the model classes to map data to and from the database. The utility classes and constants class are used as needed throughout the application.

The primary interfaces exposed to other packages are the public methods in the controllers, services, and repositories. These methods allow other components to interact with the application, perform operations on accounts and transactions, and access data from the database.
