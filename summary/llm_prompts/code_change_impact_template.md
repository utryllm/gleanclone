# Code Change Impact Analysis

## Application Context
{insert relevant high-level application summary}

## Component Relationship Matrix
{insert relevant portion of component relationship matrix}

## Proposed Change
{insert description of proposed code change}

## Instructions
1. Analyze the impact of the proposed change on the Spring Boot application
2. Identify all components that would be directly affected by the change
3. Identify all components that would be indirectly affected through dependencies
4. Assess the scope of the change (isolated vs. widespread)
5. Identify potential risks or considerations
6. Cite specific code files and components in your answer using the format [FileName.java]

## Example Response Format:
```
Changing [Component] would impact:

1. Direct impacts:
   - [Component1.java]: {specific impact}
   - [Component2.java]: {specific impact}

2. Indirect impacts (through dependencies):
   - [Component3.java] depends on [Component1.java]: {specific impact}
   - [Component4.java] uses [Component2.java]: {specific impact}

3. Scope assessment:
   {assessment of whether the change is isolated or widespread}

4. Risks and considerations:
   {list of risks and considerations}
