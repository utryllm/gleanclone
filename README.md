# Spring Boot Application Analyzer

This tool provides intelligent analysis of Spring Boot applications using LLMs (Large Language Models) with context-aware prompting. It leverages the summaries, diagrams, and other artifacts generated by the `glean_code_ds.py` script to provide detailed answers to questions about the application's architecture, functionality, and potential changes.

## Features

- **Semantic Search**: Finds the most relevant components for any query using embeddings
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Builds prompts with just the right amount of context for each query
- **Self-Verification**: Automatically checks responses for consistency with the codebase
- **Specialized Templates**: Includes templates for different types of analysis:
  - General application analysis
  - Feature implementation planning
  - Code change impact assessment

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (or other compatible LLM provider)
- Generated summary files from `glean_code_ds.py`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   LLM_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo
   LLM_TEMPERATURE=0.2
   LLM_MAX_TOKENS=2000
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   ```
4. Install the package in development mode:
   ```
   python install_dev.py
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```
from spring_boot_analyzer import QueryProcessor

processor = QueryProcessor(summary_dir="summary")
response = processor.process_query("How does the transaction flow work in this application?")
print(response)
```

### Interactive Mode

Run the analyzer in interactive mode:

```
python run_analyzer.py interactive
```

### Demo Mode

Run the analyzer in demo mode:

```
python run_analyzer.py demo
```

### Query Mode

Run the analyzer in query mode:

```
python run_analyzer.py query "How does authentication work in this application?"
```

### Feature Implementation Analysis

Run the analyzer to analyze feature implementation:

```
python run_analyzer.py feature "Add a feature to allow users to set up recurring transfers between accounts"
```

### Code Change Impact Analysis

Run the analyzer to assess the impact of code changes:

```
python run_analyzer.py impact "Change the Transaction entity to include a 'category' field for transaction categorization"
```
